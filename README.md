# How to use
STEP 1: PREPARE YOUR COMPUTER

• Ensure you have Python 3.10 or newer installed.

• Confirm that your system has a working microphone and speakers/headphones for voice interaction.

• Create a dedicated folder on your computer to house your project files.

STEP 2: CREATE AND ACTIVATE A VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT

• Open your command line interface (Terminal or Command Prompt).

• Navigate to your project folder.

• Create a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies.

• Activate the virtual environment before installing any packages.

STEP 3: INSTALL REQUIRED SOFTWARE PACKAGES

• Install all necessary Python libraries required by your project, such as:

• The web app framework

• Speech recognition and processing tools

• AI client libraries

• Audio handling packages

STEP 4: CONFIGURE THE AI ACCESS KEY

• Register or log in to your AI service provider (Groq).

• Retrieve your unique API key.

• Make sure this key is updated in your project’s configuration to enable
communication with the AI backend.

STEP 5: ORGANIZE AND SAVE YOUR PROJECT FILES

• Place your application code and resources, including the main application script, inside your project folder.

• Ensure all dependencies and configurations are correctly linked and saved.

STEP 6: LAUNCH THE APPLICATION

• Run the application using the appropriate command via your terminal with the virtual environment activated.

• This command will start a local web server and present you with a link,usually `http://localhost:8501`, to open your app in the browser.

STEP 7: ACCESS AND USE THE APPLICATION

• Open the provided local web address in a modern web browser.

• You will see a sleek, clean interface that follows a light theme, with a lot of whitespace and large, elegant typography for headings.

• Select the accessibility mode you need:

• Voice interaction for visual impairment with audio input/output

• Text input for hearing impairment

• Simplified content for cognitive impairment

• Interactive riddles combining multiple accessibility supports

• Follow the straightforward on-screen prompts to ask questions, listen toresponses, or solve riddles.

• The design will feature subtle shadows and rounded corners on cards, anuncluttered layout organized vertically with consistent spacing andpadding for comfortable reading and interaction.

• Buttons and interactive elements will have gentle hover effects, ensuring a smooth user experience.

**STEP 8: HANDLE PERMISSIONS AND SETTINGS**

• Allow your browser to access your microphone when prompted, necessary for voice-based features.

• Adjust your device volume and microphone settings for best interaction results.

STEP 9 : TROUBLESHOOT IF NEEDED

• If voice features don’t respond, verify microphone permissions and hardware settings.

• If AI responses don’t appear, confirm your API key is correct and that your device has internet access.

• Look at the terminal/command prompt logs for error messages to guide troubleshooting.
